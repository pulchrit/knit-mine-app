## Summary: 
Store knitting project and stitch patterns and post your own knit projects in Knit Mine. 

### Save project and stitch patterns
Having trouble finding that daisy stitch pattern or that beautiful lace scarf pattern in your long list of knitting bookmarks? Save those patterns in Knit Mine and you can easily browse or search for them.

A project pattern contains instructions for knitting a particular thing—like a scarf, hat, or sweater. The project pattern lives on another website and you store reference to it in Knit Mine.

A stitch pattern contains instructions for knitting a particular stitch—like daisy stitch or stockinette stitch. The stitch pattern also lives on another site and you store reference to it in Knit Mine.

### Save your own creations
What kind of hat did you make for Grandma's last birthday again? You know you changed the needle size on your daughter's scarf, but you can't recall what you changed it to. Find the answers and keep a record of your beautiful work by saving your projects to Knit Mine.

You can save information about projects you’ve made and upload a photo of the finished piece. Include information about the yarn, needle size, who you made it for, and which project or stitch patterns you used.
